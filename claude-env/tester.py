string2 = " Here is an example of a proof by contradiction:\n\nProve that the square root of 2 is irrational.\n\nProof:\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational. That means we can express sqrt(2) as a fraction a/b in simplest terms where a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0. \n\n(sqrt(2))^2 = 2   (squaring both sides)\na^2/b^2 = 2\na^2 = 2b^2\n\nThis means a^2 is an even number. Since the square of an integer can only be even if the integer itself is even, a must also be an even number. Write a = 2c where c is an integer.\n\nSubstituting 2c for a:\n(2c)^2 = 2b^2 \n4c^2 = 2b^2\n2c^2 = b^2\n\nTherefore b^2 is also an even number, which means b must also be even.\n\nBut we assumed a/b was in simplest terms. This means a and b have no common factors. They cannot both be even. This contradicts our original assumption that sqrt(2) can be written as a fraction a/b in simplest terms. \n\nTherefore, by contradiction, sqrt(2) must be irrational.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1) Assume the opposite of what you are trying to prove \n2) Use logic and deductions to show this assumption leads to a contradiction\n3) Conclude that the original assumption must have been false, proving the statement you originally set out to show.\n\nLet me know if this helps explain the method or if you have any other questions!"

claude2guide = "Here is a detailed study guide on the requested Discrete Mathematics topics with a particular focus on proof by induction per your learning goal:\n\nProof by Contradiction\n- A proof by contradiction starts by assuming the opposite of what you are trying to prove. It then follows logical steps that lead to a contradiction, thereby showing the initial assumption must have been false.\n- Key concepts: negation, contradiction, counterexample\n- Can be tested by giving a statement and asking to prove it by contradiction. Need to correctly state the negation, logically deduce a contradiction, and conclude the initial statement must be true.\n- Example: Prove that √2 is irrational.  \nProof: Assume √2 is rational. Then √2 = p/q for some integers p and q with no common factors. Squaring both sides gives 2 = p2/q2. So p2 must be even. So p must be even. Write p = 2k for some integer k. Substituting gives 2q2 = 4k2. Cancelling the 2 gives a contradiction, since the left side has no common factors but the right side clearly has 2 as a common factor. Since a contradiction was reached, our assumption must be false. Therefore √2 is irrational.\n\nProof by Induction \n- Proof by induction demonstrates something is true for all natural numbers by showing it holds for 1 and that if it is true for any number n then it must also be true for n+1. This shows by induction it is true for all natural numbers.\n- Key concepts: base case, induction hypothesis, induction step \n- Tested by giving statement about natural numbers and ask to prove by induction. Need to state base case, write induction hypothesis, show it true for n+1 using the assumption for n.\n- You indicated wanting more depth on this topic:\n  - Make sure you clearly understand each step - write out the base case, write out the hypothesis, use the hypothesis to deduce the case for n+1\n  - Common mistakes are not using the hypothesis in the last step or not covering all details\n  - For more complex proofs, break into smaller logical steps and prove each piece building on the last\n  - Examples:\n    1. Prove ∑ki=1 i = k(k+1)/2\n    Proof: \n    Base case k=1: ∑1i=1 i  = 1 = 1(1+1)/2  \n    Hypothesis: Assume true for k. Then ∑ki=1 i = k(k+1)/2\n    Step: ∑k+1i=1 i = (∑ki=1 i) + (k+1)\n                   = [by hypothesis] k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)  \n                   = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2\n                   = (k+1)(k+2)/2\n    Therefore, by induction, true for all natural k.\n\n    2. Additional examples and practice problems on induction attached in Appendix A. Please let me know if you would like me to explain any of those examples in more detail!\n\nSet Notation and Operations\n- Key symbols: \n    - Element of: ∈\n    - Subset: ⊆ \n    - Proper Subset: ⊂\n    - Union: ∪ \n    - Intersection: ∩\n    - Complement: '\n    - Cartesian Product: X × Y\n- Concepts like disjoint sets, power sets\n- Tested by set notation questions (identify relationship between sets, find complements/intersections etc.)\n- Examples:\n    - Let A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {odd integers less than 10}\n    - Then A ⊆ B (A is a subset of B)\n    - Let C = {1, 2, 3, 4}, then C' = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} \n\nSet Equivalence\n- Two sets are equivalent if they contain the same elements\n- Can test by asking to prove or disprove set equivalence\n- Uses ideas of subset/superset to demonstrate equality of sets\n- Example:\n    Let X = {a, b, c, d} and Y = {b, d, a, c}\n    Then X = Y (the sets contain the same elements so they are equal)\n\nThis covers the key topics you requested for your Discrete Math exam preparation.
