(Easy - Multiple Choice)\nWhich symbol represents \"is an element of\"?\na) ⊆\nb) ∈\nc) ⊂\nd) ∉\n\nAnswer: b) ∈\nExplanation: The symbol ∈ is used to denote that an element belongs to a set. For example, 3 ∈ {1,2,3,4} means 3 is an element of the set {1,2,3,4}.\n\nQ2. (Medium - True/False)\nIf A = {1,2,3} and B = {3,4,5}, then A ∪ B = {1,2,3,4,5} and A ∩ B = {3}.\n\nAnswer: True\nExplanation: The union (∪) includes all elements that appear in either set without duplicates, while the intersection (∩) includes only elements that appear in both sets. Here, 3 is the only element in both sets.\n\nQ3. (Hard - Short Answer)\nGiven sets A = {x | x is a prime number less than 10} and B = {x | x is an odd number less than 10}, find:\na) A\nb) B\nc) A ∩ B\n\nAnswer: \na) A = {2,3,5,7}\nb) B = {1,3,5,7,9}\nc) A ∩ B = {3,5,7}\n\nExplanation: First, list all prime numbers less than 10 for set A. Then list all odd numbers less than 10 for set B. The intersection contains numbers that are both prime and odd.\n\nQ4. (Medium - Multiple Choice)\nWhat is the correct set-builder notation for \"all positive integers less than 5\"?\na) {x ∈ ℤ | x > 0 ∧ x < 5}\nb) {x ∈ ℕ | x ≤ 5}\nc) {x ∈ ℤ | x ≥ 0 ∧ x < 5}\nd) {x ∈ ℕ | x < 5}\n\nAnswer: d) {x ∈ ℕ | x < 5}\nExplanation: This notation correctly specifies that x must be a natural number (positive integer) and less than 5, resulting in the set {1,2,3,4}.\n\nQ5. (Hard - Short Answer)\nIf U = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, A = {1,2,3}, and B = {2,4,6}, find:\na) A\\'\nb) B\\'\nc) A\\' ∩ B\\'\n\nAnswer:\na) A\\' = {4,5,6}\nb) B\\' = {1,3,5}\nc) A\\' ∩ B\\' = {5}\n\nExplanation: The complement of a set contains all elements in the universal set that are not in the original set. The intersection of the complements contains elements that are in neither A nor B.\n\nWould you like me to continue with questions for the other sessions?"
