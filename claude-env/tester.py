string = "Session 3: Set Notation and Basic Operations Study Questions\n\n1. Multiple Choice:\nWhich of the following correctly represents \"the set of all real numbers x where x is greater than 2\"?\na) {x ∈ ℝ | x > 2}\nb) {x ∈ ℝ : x ≥ 2}\nc) {x > 2 | x ∈ ℝ}\nd) {2 < x : x ∈ ℝ}\n\nAnswer: a) {x ∈ ℝ | x > 2}\nExplanation: This is the correct set-builder notation, specifying the universe (ℝ) and the condition (x > 2) in proper format.\n\n2. True/False:\nIf A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 2, 1}, then A ≠ B.\n\nAnswer: False\nExplanation: Sets are unordered collections of elements. The order doesn\\'t matter, so if two sets contain the same elements, they are equal.\n\n3. Short Answer:\nGiven sets A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, what is A ∩ B?\n\nAnswer: {3, 4}\nExplanation: The intersection contains elements that appear in both sets. Only 3 and 4 appear in both A and B.\n\n4. Multiple Choice:\nWhat is the cardinality of the power set of {a, b, c}?\na) 3\nb) 6\nc) 8\nd) 9\n\nAnswer: c) 8\nExplanation: For a set with n elements, its power set has 2ⁿ elements. Here, n = 3, so 2³ = 8.\n\n5. Short Answer:\nWrite the complement of the set {1, 2, 3} if the universal set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nAnswer: {4, 5, 6}\nExplanation: The complement contains all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set.\n\n6. True/False:\nThe empty set ∅ is a subset of every set.\n\nAnswer: True\nExplanation: By definition, the empty set is a subset of all sets, including itself.\n\n7. Short Answer:\nIf A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8}, what is A - B?\n\nAnswer: {1, 3}\nExplanation: Set difference A - B contains elements that are in A but not in B.\n\n8. Multiple Choice:\nWhich operation is represented by (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)?\na) Complement\nb) Symmetric Difference\nc) Union\nd) Intersection\n\nAnswer: b) Symmetric Difference\nExplanation: This operation gives elements that are in either set but not in both, which is the definition of symmetric difference.\n\n9. Long Answer:\nGiven sets A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {2, 3, 4}, and C = {3, 4, 5}, prove that (A ∪ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C).\n\nAnswer: \nLet\\'s prove this using element-chasing method:\n\nStep 1: Show (A ∪ B) ∩ C ⊆ (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C)\nLet x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ C\nThen x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∈ C\nIf x ∈ A, then x ∈ A ∩ C\nIf x ∈ B, then x ∈ B ∩ C\nTherefore x ∈ (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C)\n\nStep 2: Show (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C) ⊆ (A ∪ B) ∩ C\nLet x ∈ (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C)\nThen x ∈ (A ∩ C) or x ∈ (B ∩ C)\nIf x ∈ A ∩ C, then x ∈ A and x ∈ C, so x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ C\nIf x ∈ B ∩ C, then x ∈ B and x ∈ C, so x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ C\nTherefore x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ C\n\n10. Long Answer:\nUsing set-builder notation and basic set operations, construct and prove that the set of all integers that are multiples of both 2 and 3 is equal to the set of all integers that are multiples of 6.\n\nAnswer:\nLet A = {x ∈ ℤ | ∃k ∈ ℤ (x = 2k)}\nLet B = {x ∈ ℤ | ∃k ∈ ℤ (x = 3k)}\nLet C = {x ∈ ℤ | ∃k ∈ ℤ (x = 6k)}\n\nProof:\nStep 1: Show A ∩ B ⊆ C\nLet x ∈ A ∩ B\nThen x = 2m and x = 3n for some m,n ∈ ℤ\nThis means 2m = 3n\nTherefore n = 2k and m = 3k for some k ∈ ℤ\nThus x = 6k, so x ∈ C\n\nStep 2: Show C ⊆ A ∩ B\nLet x ∈ C\nThen x = 6k for some k ∈ ℤ\nTherefore x = 2(3k) and x = 3(2k)\nThus x ∈ A and x ∈ B\nSo x ∈ A ∩ B\n\nTherefore, A ∩ B = C"
