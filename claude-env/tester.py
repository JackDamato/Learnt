string2 = " Here is an example of a proof by contradiction:\n\nProve that the square root of 2 is irrational.\n\nProof:\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that the square root of 2 is rational. That means we can express sqrt(2) as a fraction a/b in simplest terms where a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0. \n\n(sqrt(2))^2 = 2   (squaring both sides)\na^2/b^2 = 2\na^2 = 2b^2\n\nThis means a^2 is an even number. Since the square of an integer can only be even if the integer itself is even, a must also be an even number. Write a = 2c where c is an integer.\n\nSubstituting 2c for a:\n(2c)^2 = 2b^2 \n4c^2 = 2b^2\n2c^2 = b^2\n\nTherefore b^2 is also an even number, which means b must also be even.\n\nBut we assumed a/b was in simplest terms. This means a and b have no common factors. They cannot both be even. This contradicts our original assumption that sqrt(2) can be written as a fraction a/b in simplest terms. \n\nTherefore, by contradiction, sqrt(2) must be irrational.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1) Assume the opposite of what you are trying to prove \n2) Use logic and deductions to show this assumption leads to a contradiction\n3) Conclude that the original assumption must have been false, proving the statement you originally set out to show.\n\nLet me know if this helps explain the method or if you have any other questions!"
