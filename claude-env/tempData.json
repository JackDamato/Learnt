    "study_guide": " Here is a detailed study guide on induction and proof by contradiction for your Discrete Math exam, with a focus on writing proofs to align with your learning goal:\n\nInduction\n- Definition: A method of proof typically used to prove that a statement is true for all natural numbers. Relies on mathematical induction which states that if P(1) is true and P(k) implies P(k+1) for all k \u2265 1, then P(n) is true for all n \u2265 1. \n\n- Concepts:\n\u2022 Base case - prove the statement is true for n=1 or n=0, depending on what you are starting from\n\u2022 Induction hypothesis - assume the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k\n\u2022 Inductive step - Use the assumption in the previous step to show that the statement must then also be true for k+1\n\u2022 Conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers n \u2265 1 or n \u2265 0\n\n- Testing on Exams:\n\u2022 Be provided a statement about a property of natural numbers and asked to prove it is true for all natural numbers using induction\n\u2022 Be provided an incorrect inductive proof and asked to identify the flaw\n\n- Examples: \nProve that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2.\nBase case (n = 1): The first odd number is 1. Sum is 12 = 1. True.\nInductive hypothesis: Assume the statement holds for some k, that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k2.\nInductive step: Consider the sum of the first (k+1) odd numbers. This is equal to [sum of first k odd numbers] + (2k+1) by the definition of an odd number. By inductive hypothesis, [sum of first k odd numbers] = k2. So the sum of the first (k+1) odd numbers is k2 + (2k+1). This factors to (k+1)2. \nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2 for all n \u2265 1.\n\nProof by Contradiction\n- Definition: To prove a statement is true by assuming it is false and showing that assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\n- Concepts:  \n\u2022 Assume the opposite of what you are trying to prove\n\u2022 Use logic, definitions, other proven statements to arrive at a contradiction\n\u2022 Since a contradiction is always false, the original assumption must have been false\n\u2022 Therefore, the actual statement must be true\n\n- Testing on Exams:\n\u2022 Be provided a statement and asked to prove it is true using proof by contradiction\n\u2022 Be provided an incorrect proof by contradiction and asked to identify the flaw  \n\n- Examples:\nProve \u221a2 is irrational using proof by contradiction.\nProof: \nAssume for contradiction that \u221a2 is rational. Then we can express \u221a2 as a fraction a/b in simplest terms where a and b are integers with no common factors. Squaring both sides: 2 = (a/b)2. This implies 2b2= a2. Since 2 divides the left side, 2 must divide the right side. So a2 is even, which means a must also be even. So we can write a = 2c for some integer c. Substituting into 2b2 = a2 gives us 2b2 = (2c)2 = 4c2. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us b2 = 2c2. But since the left side is b2, b2 must be even, which means b must be even. But if both a and b are even, then they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts that a/b is in simplest terms. Therefore, the original assumption must be false. \u221a2 cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, so \u221a2 must be irrational.\n\nI structured the overall study guide to first introduce the key definitions and concepts for each proof technique, discuss how they may be tested on an exam, and provide a full detailed example to demonstrate the structure and logic. The examples showcase writing complete, valid proofs, which aligns with your learning goal of improving proof writing skills.
