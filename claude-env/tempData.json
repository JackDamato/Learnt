Parent Chain\n- Longest continuous carbon chain\n- Determines base name (methane, ethane, propane, etc.)\n- Must include the functional group if present\n\n2. Substituents\n- Groups attached to parent chain\n- Named with position numbers and prefixes\n- Multiple same substituents use di-, tri-, tetra- prefixes\n\n3. Numbering Rules\n- Start numbering from end closer to first substituent\n- Give lowest possible numbers to substituents\n- When equal, alphabetical order decides\n\nCommon Functional Groups:\n- Alkanes (-ane)\n- Alkenes (-ene)\n- Alkynes (-yne)\n- Alcohols (-ol)\n- Carboxylic acids (-oic acid)\n- Aldehydes (-al)\n- Ketones (-one)\n\nFOCUSED PRACTICE: Converting Names to Structures\nStep-by-Step Process:\n1. Identify parent chain length\n2. Draw main carbon chain\n3. Add substituents at numbered positions\n4. Add functional groups\n5. Complete with hydrogens\n\nExample Questions:\n1. Draw 2-methylpentane\nSolution:\n- Parent chain: 5 carbons (pentane)\n- Methyl group at position 2\n- Complete with hydrogens\n\n2. Name: CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\nSolution:\n- Parent chain: 4 carbons (butane)\n- Methyl at position 2\n- Name: 2-methylbutane\n\nSECTION 2: LEWIS STRUCTURE DIAGRAMS\nDefinition: Representation showing all valence electrons in a molecule\n\nKey Components:\n1. Atomic Symbols\n2. Bonding electrons (shared)\n3. Nonbonding electrons (lone pairs)\n4. Formal charges\n\nRules for Drawing:\n1. Count total valence electrons\n2. Connect atoms with single bonds\n3. Complete octets\n4. Check formal charges\n5. Consider resonance structures\n\nCommon Patterns:\n- Carbon: 4 bonds\n- Nitrogen: 3 bonds, 1 lone pair\n- Oxygen: 2 bonds, 2 lone pairs\n- Halogens: 1 bond, 3 lone pairs\n\nSECTION 3: HYBRIDIZATION\nDefinition: Mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals\n\nTypes:\n1. sp\u00b3 hybridization\n- 4 equivalent orbitals\n- Tetrahedral geometry (109.5\u00b0)\n- Single bonds only\n\n2. sp\u00b2 hybridization\n- 3 equivalent orbitals\n- Trigonal planar geometry (120\u00b0)\n- Contains double bond\n\n3. sp hybridization\n- 2 equivalent orbitals\n- Linear geometry (180\u00b0)\n- Contains triple bond\n\nFOCUSED PRACTICE: Identifying Hybridization\nSteps to Determine:\n1. Count bonds and lone pairs around atom\n2. sp\u00b3: 4 groups total\n3. sp\u00b2: 3 groups total\n4. sp: 2 groups total\n\nExample Questions:\n1. Determine hybridization of each carbon in CH3CH=CH2\nSolution:\n- First C (CH3): sp\u00b3 (4 single bonds)\n- Second C (CH=): sp\u00b2 (double bond + 2 single bonds)\n- Third C (=CH2): sp\u00b2 (double bond + 2 single bonds)\n\nPractice Problems:\n1. Draw the structure for 3-ethyl-2-methylpentane\n2. Determine hybridization of all carbons in CH3C\u2261CH\n3. Draw Lewis structure for CH3COOH\n\nExam Tips:\n- Practice drawing structures quickly\n- Memorize common functional groups\n- Learn to recognize hybridization patterns\n- Check for complete octets\n- Verify correct number of hydrogens\n- Double-check IUPAC naming rules\n\nRemember:\n- Always count carbons carefully\n- Pay attention to bond angles\n- Consider 3D structure\n- Practice with multiple examples\n- Draw neat, clear structures\n\nThis guide focuses on your specific learning goals while covering all essential topics. Regular practice with structure drawing and hybridization identification will improve your skills significantly.",
