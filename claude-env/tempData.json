Types of Hybridization:\n   - sp\u00b3: tetrahedral geometry (109.5\u00b0)\n   - sp\u00b2: trigonal planar geometry (120\u00b0)\n   - sp: linear geometry (180\u00b0)\n\n2. How to Determine Hybridization:\n   * Count the number of groups around the atom (including lone pairs)\n   * 4 groups = sp\u00b3\n   * 3 groups = sp\u00b2\n   * 2 groups = sp\n\nDetailed Focus (Learning Goal):\n- Steps to identify hybridization:\n1. Draw the Lewis structure\n2. Count total number of electron domains (bonds + lone pairs)\n3. Apply VSEPR theory\n4. Determine geometric shape\n5. Assign hybridization based on geometry\n\nCommon Exam Questions:\n1. Determine the hybridization of each carbon in: CH\u2083CH=CH\u2082\n2. Identify the hybridization state of the nitrogen in NH\u2083\n\nExample Solutions:\n1. CH\u2083CH=CH\u2082\n   - First C (CH\u2083): 4 bonds, sp\u00b3\n   - Second C (CH=): 3 bonds (including double bond), sp\u00b2\n   - Third C (=CH\u2082): 3 bonds (including double bond), sp\u00b2\n\n2. NH\u2083\n   - N has 3 bonds and 1 lone pair = 4 total electron domains\n   - Therefore, N is sp\u00b3 hybridized\n\nSECTION 2: IR SPECTROSCOPY\n--------------------------\n\nDefinition:\nInfrared spectroscopy is a technique that measures the absorption of infrared radiation by chemical bonds in molecules.\n\nKey Concepts:\n1. Characteristic Absorptions:\n   - O-H stretch: 3200-3600 cm\u207b\u00b9\n   - N-H stretch: 3300-3500 cm\u207b\u00b9\n   - C=O stretch: 1670-1780 cm\u207b\u00b9\n   - C-H stretch: 2850-3000 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\n2. Factors Affecting IR Absorption:\n   - Bond strength\n   - Atomic mass\n   - Environment of the bond\n\nCommon Exam Questions:\n1. Identify functional groups from an IR spectrum\n2. Predict major IR absorptions for a given molecule\n\nExample:\nIdentify the functional groups in a molecule showing peaks at:\n3350 cm\u207b\u00b9, 2950 cm\u207b\u00b9, and 1725 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\nSolution:\n- 3350 cm\u207b\u00b9: N-H or O-H stretch\n- 2950 cm\u207b\u00b9: C-H stretch\n- 1725 cm\u207b\u00b9: C=O stretch\n\nSECTION 3: MASS SPECTROMETRY\n----------------------------\n\nDefinition:\nMass spectrometry is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions.\n\nKey Concepts (Learning Goal):\n1. Molecular Formula Determination:\n   - Molecular ion peak (M\u207a)\n   - Isotope patterns\n   - Fragment patterns\n\n2. Common Rules:\n   - Nitrogen Rule\n   - Double Bond Equivalents (DBE)\n   - Isotope ratios\n\nSteps to Determine Molecular Formula:\n1. Identify molecular ion peak (M\u207a)\n2. Look for isotope patterns\n3. Apply nitrogen rule\n4. Calculate DBE\n5. Consider common fragments\n\nCommon Exam Questions:\n1. Calculate the DBE for a molecular formula\n2. Determine molecular formula from mass spectrum\n\nExample:\nDetermine the molecular formula for a compound with:\n- M\u207a = 58\n- Even mass number\n- Fragment at m/z = 43 (base peak)\n\nSolution:\n1. Even mass \u2192 even number of nitrogens (or zero)\n2. M\u207a = 58 suggests C\u2083H\u2086O or C\u2084H\u2081\u2080\n3. Fragment at 43 (loss of CH\u2083) suggests C\u2083H\u2086O\n4. Therefore, molecular formula is C\u2083H\u2086O (acetone)\n\nStudy Tips:\n1. Practice drawing structures and identifying hybridization\n2. Memorize common IR absorption frequencies\n3. Learn to recognize common mass spectral patterns\n4. Work through practice problems regularly\n5. Create flashcards for common values and patterns\n\nRemember to:\n- Draw structures when solving problems\n- Show all work in calculations\n- Consider multiple possibilities\n- Check answers for reasonableness",
