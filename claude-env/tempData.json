Calculating required centripetal force\n2. Finding velocity given radius and period\n3. Determining tension in string for vertical circular motion\n4. Banking angle problems\n\nExample Problem:\nA 2kg mass is swung in a horizontal circle of radius 1.5m at 3m/s. Find the tension in the string.\nSolution:\n1. Identify: Need centripetal force (tension)\n2. F = mv\u00b2/r\n3. F = (2kg)(3m/s)\u00b2/(1.5m)\n4. F = 12N\n\nSECTION 2: THE ENERGY PRINCIPLE (Special Focus)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nKey Concepts:\n- Energy is conserved in isolated systems\n- Work-Energy Theorem: W_net = \u0394KE\n- Different forms of energy can transform into each other\n\nImportant Equations:\n- Work: W = F\u00b7d\u00b7cos\u03b8\n- Kinetic Energy: KE = \u00bdmv\u00b2\n- Energy Principle: \u0394E_system = W_external\n- Power: P = W/t = F\u00b7v\n\nSetting Up Energy Principle Problems (Special Focus):\n1. System Identification:\n   - Clearly define what's in your system\n   - Identify external forces doing work\n   \n2. Energy Types Present:\n   - List all forms of energy initially\n   - List all forms of energy finally\n   \n3. Equation Structure:\n   Initial Energy + Work_external = Final Energy\n   \nExample Problem:\nA 5kg block slides down a 30\u00b0 incline with friction coefficient 0.2. Find its final velocity if it starts from rest and travels 4m.\nSolution:\n1. System = block\n2. Initial: PE_i = mgh = mg(4sin30\u00b0)\n   Final: KE_f = \u00bdmv\u00b2\n3. Work by friction: W_f = -\u03bcmgcos30\u00b0(4)\n4. mgh - \u03bcmgcos30\u00b0(4) = \u00bdmv\u00b2\n5. Solve for v\n\nSECTION 3: POTENTIAL ENERGIES\n----------------------------\n\nKey Concepts:\n- Energy stored due to position or configuration\n- Conservative forces have path-independent potential energy\n- Types: gravitational, elastic, electric\n\nImportant Equations:\n- Gravitational PE: U_g = mgh\n- Elastic PE: U_e = \u00bdkx\u00b2\n- Conservation of Energy: E_i = E_f (when no external work)\n\nKey Definitions:\n- Conservative force: Work is path-independent\n- Reference point: Zero position for PE\n- Spring constant: Measure of spring stiffness\n\nCommon Exam Questions:\n1. Spring compression/extension problems\n2. Height-to-velocity conversions\n3. Combined gravitational and elastic PE\n4. Conservation of energy with multiple forms\n\nExample Problem:\nA 0.5kg mass compresses a spring (k=200N/m) by 0.2m. How high will it bounce?\nSolution:\n1. Initial: PE_elastic = \u00bdkx\u00b2\n2. Final: PE_gravitational = mgh\n3. \u00bdkx\u00b2 = mgh\n4. h = (200)(0.2)\u00b2/(2)(0.5)(9.8)\n5. h = 0.408m\n\nPractice Tips:\n1. Draw clear diagrams\n2. List given quantities\n3. Identify energy types present\n4. Write conservation equation\n5. Solve step by step\n\nRemember:\n- Energy is always conserved\n- Check units throughout\n- Consider sign conventions\n- Reference points matter for PE\n\nThis study guide emphasizes proper equation setup and energy principle problem-solving as requested. Practice multiple problems of each type for better understanding.",
