    "study_guide": " Here is a detailed study guide on the requested Proof-Based Linear Algebra topics focused on helping you prepare for your exam. The guide covers Change of Basis, Matrix Representations of Homomorphic Maps, Proving Linearity and Linear Independence in depth.\n\nChange of Basis\n- Definition: A change of basis is a transformation that represents the same vector space using a different basis. \n- Concepts: Spanning sets, linear independence, coordinate vectors, transition matrices\n- Exam Testing: You may be asked to find a transition matrix between two bases or to represent a transformation matrix in a new basis. \n- Example Question: Let V be a vector space with basis B = {v1, v2}. Let B' = {w1, w2} be another basis where w1 = 2v1 + v2 and w2 = v1 - v2. Find the transition matrix P that transforms coordinates from B to B'.\n- Solution: The columns of P will be the coordinate vectors of w1 and w2 in basis B. [w1]B = [2v1 + v2]B = [2 1], [w2]B = [v1 - v2]B = [1 -1]. Therefore, the transition matrix is P = [2 1; 1 -1].\n\nMatrix Representations of Homomorphic Maps\n- Definition: A linear transformation T: V \u2192 W between vector spaces can be represented as a matrix M if bases are chosen for V and W. M will map a coordinate vector in one basis to a coordinate vector in the other basis.\n- Concepts: Kernel, image, isomorphism, rank-nullity theorem\n- Exam Testing: You may be asked to find a matrix representation for a given linear map or transformation.\n- Example Question: Let T: R3 \u2192 R2 be defined by T(x, y, z) = (2x + y, x + z). Find the standard matrix for T.  \n- Solution: Choosing standard bases, [T(1,0,0)] = (2,0) = (2,0), [T(0,1,0)] = (1,0), [T(0,0,1)] = (0,1). Therefore, the standard matrix is [[2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]].\n\nProving Linearity  \n- Definition: A function T: V \u2192 W is linear if T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) and T(cv) = cT(v) for all u,v in V and scalar c.\n- Concepts: Vector addition, scalar multiplication, linear combination\n- Exam Testing: You may be asked to prove a given function is linear by verifying the conditions in the definition.\n- Example Question: Prove that the function T: R3 \u2192 R2 defined by T(x, y, z) = (x + 2z, y - 3z) is linear.\n- Solution: Let u = (x1, y1, z1), v = (x2, y2, z2). Then T(u + v) = T(x1+x2, y1+y2, z1+z2) = ((x1+x2) + 2(z1+z2), (y1+y2) - 3(z1+z2)) = (x1 + 2z1, y1 - 3z1) + (x2 + 2z2, y2 - 3z2) = T(u) + T(v). \nAlso, T(cv) = T(cx2, cy2, cz2) = (cx2 + 2cz2, cy2 - 3cz2) = c(x2 + 2z2, y2 - 3z2) = cT(v).\nTherefore, T is linear.\n\nLinear Independence\n- Definition: A set of vectors {v1, ..., vn} is linearly independent if the only solution to c1v1 + ... + cnvn = 0 is c1 = c2 = ... = cn = 0.\n- Concepts: Linear combinations, spanning sets, basis\n- Exam Testing: You may be asked to prove or disprove linear independence for a given set of vectors.\n- Example Question: Determine if the set of vectors U = {(1, 2, 4), (2, 0, -1), (3, 5, 2)} in R3 is linearly independent.\n- Solution: We need to solve the equation:\nc1(1, 2, 4) + c2(2, 0, -1) + c3(3, 5, 2) = (0, 0, 0)\nThis gives us the system: \nc1 + 2c2 + 3c3 = 0\n2c1 - c2 + 5c3 = 0  \n4c1 - c2 + 2c3 = 0\nThe only solution is c1 = c2 = c3 = 0. Therefore, U is linearly independent.\n\nI focused this study guide on helping you get better at writing proofs and representing maps as matrices based on your learning goals.
