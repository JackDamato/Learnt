Set Equivalence\n\n1. PROOF BY CONTRADICTION\nDefinition:\n- A method of proof where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove, show this leads to a contradiction, thus proving the original statement is true.\n\nKey Concepts:\n- Start by assuming the negation of the statement\n- Follow logical steps until reaching a contradiction\n- Conclude the original statement must be true\n\nCommon Exam Questions:\n- Prove that \u221a2 is irrational\n- Prove there are infinitely many primes\n- Prove logical statements using contradiction\n\nExample:\nProve that \u221a2 is irrational\nSolution:\n1. Assume \u221a2 is rational\n2. Then \u221a2 = a/b where a,b are coprime integers\n3. 2 = a\u00b2/b\u00b2\n4. 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2\n5. a\u00b2 is even, so a is even\n6. Let a = 2k\n7. 2b\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2\n8. b\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2\n9. b is even\n10. Contradiction: a,b can't both be even if coprime\nTherefore, \u221a2 is irrational\n\n2. PROOF BY INDUCTION (EXTENDED SECTION)\nDefinition:\n- A method to prove statements about all natural numbers by establishing a base case and showing the statement holds for n+1 if it holds for n.\n\nKey Components:\n1. Base Case: Prove true for initial value (usually n=1)\n2. Inductive Hypothesis: Assume true for k\n3. Inductive Step: Prove true for k+1\n\nTypes of Induction:\n- Weak Induction\n- Strong Induction\n- Structural Induction\n\nCommon Patterns:\n1. Summation formulas\n2. Divisibility properties\n3. Inequalities\n4. Geometric sequences\n\nDetailed Example:\nProve: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2\n\nSolution:\n1. Base Case: n=1\n   Left side: 1\n   Right side: 1(1+1)/2 = 1 \u2713\n\n2. Inductive Hypothesis:\n   Assume true for k: 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2\n\n3. Inductive Step:\n   Prove for k+1:\n   Left side: (1 + 2 + ... + k) + (k+1)\n   = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)\n   = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2\n   = (k\u00b2 + 3k + 2)/2\n   = (k+1)(k+2)/2\n   = Right side for n=k+1 \u2713\n\nPractice Tips:\n- Always clearly state base case\n- Write out inductive hypothesis explicitly\n- Show each algebraic step\n- Verify final form matches required form\n\n3. SET NOTATION\nBasic Notation:\n- Set: {elements}\n- Element of: \u2208\n- Not element of: \u2209\n- Empty set: \u2205 or {}\n- Subset: \u2286\n- Proper subset: \u2282\n- Universal set: U\n\nSet-Builder Notation:\n{x | P(x)} = set of all x such that P(x) is true\n\nCommon Sets:\n- \u2115 (Natural numbers)\n- \u2124 (Integers)\n- \u211a (Rational numbers)\n- \u211d (Real numbers)\n\n4. SET OPERATIONS\nBasic Operations:\n- Union (A \u222a B)\n- Intersection (A \u2229 B)\n- Complement (A')\n- Difference (A - B)\n- Symmetric Difference (A \u25b3 B)\n\nProperties:\n- Commutative: A \u222a B = B \u222a A\n- Associative: (A \u222a B) \u222a C = A \u222a (B \u222a C)\n- Distributive: A \u222a (B \u2229 C) = (A \u222a B) \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\nExample:\nIf A = {1,2,3}, B = {2,3,4}\nA \u222a B = {1,2,3,4}\nA \u2229 B = {2,3}\nA - B = {1}\n\n5. SET EQUIVALENCE\nDefinition:\nTwo sets are equivalent if they have the same elements.\n\nMethods to Prove Equivalence:\n1. Double inclusion (A \u2286 B and B \u2286 A)\n2. Element-chasing\n3. Set operations and laws\n\nCommon Equivalences:\n- De Morgan's Laws:\n  (A \u222a B)' = A' \u2229 B'\n  (A \u2229 B)' = A' \u222a B'\n\nExample:\nProve: A - B = A \u2229 B'\nSolution:\nx \u2208 A - B\n\u27fa x \u2208 A and x \u2209 B\n\u27fa x \u2208 A and x \u2208 B'\n\u27fa x \u2208 A \u2229 B'\n\nEXAM PREPARATION TIPS:\n1. Practice multiple types of proofs\n2. Draw Venn diagrams for set problems\n3. Memorize key properties and laws\n4. Work through example problems step-by-step\n5. Focus extra time on induction problems\n6. Create your own problems and solve them",
